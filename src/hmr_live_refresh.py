"""Browser live-reload WebSocket connection manager.

This module is deliberately kept OUT of the hot-reload set: ``src/hmr_server.py``
excludes it from the reactive import finder. It holds live browser WebSocket
connections as in-process state (``ws_reloader.active``); if it were re-executed on
every source change, that state would be dropped and browser auto-refresh would
silently stop working. The manager therefore lives here, imported by both the
reactively-reloaded ``src.server`` (routes + mutation refreshes) and the stable
``src.hmr_server`` (file-change refreshes), so a single instance survives reloads.
